# üè° Real Estate Listings Project

This project provides a complete solution for generating and searching real estate listings using GPT-3.5 and a vector database. It is part of the Udacity Nano degree Generative AI. The task is to develop an innovative application named ‚ÄúHomeMatch‚Äù. This application leverages large language models (LLMs) and vector databases to transform standard real estate listings into personalized narratives that resonate with potential buyers‚Äô unique preferences and needs. It utilizes OpenAI‚Äôs language model for creating synthetic listings and ChromaDB for storing and retrieving these listings based on user queries. For convenience, it also includes a Streamlit-based web application to interact with the listings more easily.

## Features

	‚Ä¢	Generate Synthetic Listings: Create realistic real estate listings using GPT-3.5.
	‚Ä¢	Semantic Search: Perform semantic searches over the listings using a vector database.
	‚Ä¢	Streamlit Web App: A user-friendly interface to interact with the generated listings and perform searches.

## Project Structure

	‚Ä¢	main.py: Main file for the Streamlit app

	‚Ä¢	listingcreation.py: Script containing functions for creating and processing listings

	‚Ä¢	listingsearch.py: Script containing search-related functions
